# ðŸ‘‹Hello World, this is Mr. Poon's Studio

## Introduction to this poor coding community for all

I am living in Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long District, New Territories, HKSARG, China for a decade. When I heard lots of unhappy news from familes who are solving poverty from Internet coding equipments, especially SME-sized business NAS server for familes and 1 manpowered coder families who do not wants to married with others and express speed Internet subscriptions from Internet providers with today's Web 3.0 coding enviroment. They could not afford these of expensive cost with today's stagflation economy enviroment.
However, GitHub subscription is easy and efficient with Web 3.0 coding for today. It seems GitHub's subscriptions calculated in USD, not in cheap currency format like Argentina Pesos or South Korean Won.
We've seen YouTube by Google pushed their premium services for a long time. And we see for Argentina users they pays 119 ARS and 179 ARS for individuals and familes respctively. See the figures below for explanations. This is what I need for poor coders and users.

As you can see the gap difference on YouTube Premium, we see we paid lots of money but they are not cheap in every country except ultra low currency rates compared with HKD, USD, South Korean Won and ARS, Argentina Pesos. With cloud providers like Big 3 tech companies, Microsoft with GitHub, Google and Amazon.
They are expensive much higher there. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud, billed USD$231.00 annually per user, or, for personal developer, billed USD$4.00 every month with Pro subscription. Else you may apply for free Teams plan if you are non-profit authorities but lots of heavy verification of eligibility.
Therefore we created Mr. Poon's Studio there.

* __Who we are?__
With 3 public social pages hosted on Cloutfeed, Instagram by Meta, Odysee and coming in YouTube by Google, and 2 official bloggers when they are preparing there. Mr. Alice Poon inspired with tech passion hence when I was seeing Tiny brand PC at my young age around 1990s, I asked my parents lots of time buy PC for my family which need at least HKD$10K and my parents cannot affordable. Lots of reject and financial blocks there. Finally, at 2012, I had my very first PC, preinstalled with Windows 8 on custom build.
When I think back after I made the builds therefore, why PC are so expensive in rich areas. And imagine if there is a free PC builds for all and free official support when I am trained from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Web 3.0 companies, I can provide free support for poverty family there to remove the generation gaps with not only a free PC build, support services, but gained happiness, monetizing and much of possibility there with poverty family and individuals.
I was employed class IT administrator when I was Form 5 by Mr. Damon Yu Man Wong, I have responsibility, not only with starts and stops my classroom computer there. But with technicial support with big data hosts on Internet, when every computer breaks, I am less require to school IT admin and learnt the techniques from there. 
Therefore I was dreaming if I am school IT admin, the operation of school runs smoother with cloud based equipment.
